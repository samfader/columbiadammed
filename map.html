        <h3>Columbia Lake</h3>
        <p>The Columbia River gets its humble start here in beautiful British Columbia at 2,690 feet (820 m) above sea level.
          From here, it will discharge, on average, 180 million acre-feet, making it the fourth largest river in North America by volume, and will flow 1,210 miles to the Pacific Ocean, dropping two feet per mile. This makes the Columbia River four times as steep as the Mississippi. (source: columbia river power for the ppl book)

        <h3>Mica Dam</h3>
        <p>Located 135 km north of Revelstoke, the Mica Dam was the third and final requirement under the Columbia River Treaty signed by Canada and the United States in 1961 and ratified by Canada in 1964. The Treaty ensured the optimum conditions for producing hydroelectricity along the Columbia River downstream in the U.S. and for flood control along the entire river. Construction of the dam, one of the largest earth-filled dams in the world when it was built, began in 1967 and ended on March 23, 1973. In 1977, BC Hydro installed a powerhouse producing 1,792 MW making the Mica Dam the only Columbia River Treaty Canadian Dam to generate power. A village was constructed for the workers and their families near the site. At the peak of construction, it was home to 4000 people. The facilities in the village included a school, community centre, fire hall, police station, grocery store and post office all of closed as needs reduced. When the Revelstoke Dam was constructed in 1984, the village was relocated to higher ground to avoid the rising waters. Today it serves as housing to people who work at the Mica Dam.

          Mica Dam created Kinbasket reservoir, covering 21,000 square kilometres (8108 square miles) it is fed by the Columbia, Kicking Horse, Canoe and Wood Rivers. Portions of the vast reservoir surface were logged prior to flooding and to this day, trees are dislodged as the water levels disturb the soil.<a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/expositions-exhibitions/hydro/en/dams/?action=mica">source</a></p>

        <h3>Revelstoke Dam</h3>
        <p>Construction of the Revelstoke Dam began in 1978. This dam and generating station take advantage of the water regulation provided by the upstream Mica Dam. It is a concrete gravity dam with an earthfill dam to the west of the powerhouse. There are four generating units and capacity for two additional units.

          Construction of the Revelstoke Dam was not without controversy. This was a reflection of the increased awareness of environmental concerns in the 1970s and 80s. BC Hydro commissioned many environmental reports and produced a promotional video to ease public concerns about environmental impacts.
          
          Prior to the completion of the dam, Highway 23 was rerouted to avoid the new water levels along the 128 kilometre (80 mile) reservoir that would extend north to the Mica Dam. As well as construction, logging of the new reservoir was also a major undertaking, as all available merchantable timber was removed.</p>

        <h3>Keenleyside Dam</h3>
        <p>Hugh Keenleyside Dam (originally known as the High Arrow Dam[1] is a flood control dam spanning the Columbia River, 12 km (6.5 miles) upstream of the city of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada.

          The dam is at the outflow of what was the upper and lower Arrow Lakes, today the two lakes are joined forming one long reservoir extending 232 km (144 mi) north to Revelstoke Dam, and contains 8.76 km3 (7.1 MAF) of reservoir volume. The dam is operated by BC Hydro.[2]
          
          The 853.4 m (2,800 ft) long earth fill and concrete dam was built as part of fulfilling Canada's role in the Columbia River Treaty, along with the Duncan Dam, both were built to prevent flooding and control the flow of water in the Columbia River for downstream hydroelectric dams. It was commissioned on October 10, 1968, six months ahead of schedule.[2]
          
          Immediately downstream of the dam a 185 megawatt (MW) hydroelectric powerhouse, the Arrow Lakes Generating Station, was begun in 1999 and completed in 2002.[3] The station is owned by the Columbia Power Corporation.</p>

        <h3>Grand Coulee Dam</h3>
        <p>Grand Coulee Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally had only two powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW.[7] However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth after a number of nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means less power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.</p>

        <h3>Bonneville Dam</h3>
        <p>Bonneville Lock and Dam /ˈbɒnɪvɪl/ consists of several run-of-the-river dam structures that together complete a span of the Columbia River between the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington at River Mile 146.1.[5] The dam is located 40 miles (64 km) east of Portland, Oregon, in the Columbia River Gorge. The primary functions of Bonneville Lock and Dam are electrical power generation and river navigation. The dam was built and is managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. At the time of its construction in the 1930s it was the largest water impoundment project of its type in the nation, able to withstand flooding on an unprecedented scale.[6] Electrical power generated at Bonneville is distributed by the Bonneville Power Administration. Bonneville Lock and Dam is named for Army Capt. Benjamin Bonneville, an early explorer credited with charting much of the Oregon Trail. The Bonneville Dam Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1987.[4]</p>
